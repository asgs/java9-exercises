# About

Well, JDK 9 is out. Time to learn new Features/APIs/Methodologies and what not.

# Objective

Though Java 9 has a bunch of new things introduced (out of which a lot more have nothing to do with a regular Java programmer), the goal here is to learn a few but major features I'm interested in.

* Jigsaw
* Reactive Streams API
* HTTP/2 API
